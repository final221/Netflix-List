# My List for Netflix

A Tampermonkey userscript that presents Netflix My List as a scrollable grid, using Netflix's native hover experience.

## Installation

Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), then open the [released userscript](https://github.com/final221/Netflix-List/raw/refs/heads/main/Legacy%20My%20List%20for%20Netflix.user.js) and install it. Visit `https://www.netflix.com/browse/my-list`. The existing menu command toggles the original Netflix list, and CopyLogs exports the script's diagnostics.

## Development

Development and verification target Windows. Use Node **24.13.0** and npm **11.6.2**, as declared in package.json. Install the locked build dependency with `npm ci`.

```powershell
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run check
node --check "Legacy My List for Netflix.user.js"
git diff --check
```

Run check before rebuilding a checkout so stale committed output cannot be hidden. After changing source, rebuild before validating the resulting release. The same verification runs in [Windows CI](.github/workflows/check.yml).

Edit `src/` and use `npm run build` to generate the root userscript. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for release rules and repository change instructions.

## Live testing

Test released versions in Netflix on Windows. Save CopyLogs exports under logs/ for review; [logs/knowledge.md](logs/knowledge.md) retains distilled observations. Follow [the log-review procedure](AGENTS.md#live-log-review-and-retention) for retention and issue extraction.
